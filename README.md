### cellular-automata
ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾C++ simulation ðŸ‘¾of cellular automataðŸ‘¾

# How to run the project
Just run main.cpp and make sure to change the starting configuration of the *data.txt* file. 

## Example
**4** *represents the size of the matrix*

**0 0 1 1**     
**1 0 0 0**     
**1 1 0 1**     
**0 1 0 1**  

# DATA.TXT format
The first number ***N*** will represent the number of lines and columns in a 2d matrix.

After that you must enter ***N x N*** values from the set ***{0, 1}***. Those values will represent the initial map.

# Frames
The simulation is meant to work with *frames*, creating the impression of an animation.
The *frame number* is displayed at the top of the console and is updated automatically.

# Configurable Variables
***SLEEP_TIME*** represents the sleeping time between frames. Choosing a low sleeping time can make the animation go faster. (May be limited because printing will take some time)
***WORLD_SIZE*** represents the maximum world size. The cells will not go evolve beyond this boundary.

# How it works?
The simulation makes use of two buffers that are dependant on eachother. The initial configuration from *data.txt* will be stored in BUFFER1.
After this, the first frame will be generated by looping through BUFFER1.
For the second frame, the algorithm will loop through BUFFER2.
.....And so on.....

Each odd frame will be generated by looking through *BUFFER1*, and each even by looking at *BUFFER2*.

## Feel free to play around with different starting configurations!
